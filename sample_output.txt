Here is the analysis:

**Title Analysis**
The subject line starts with "cmd/go/internal/work:", which meets the requirement of naming the package affected, followed by a colon and space.

However, it does not use a lowercase verb for the subject after the colon. Instead, it uses "copy" in uppercase.

Status: FAIL

**Body Analysis**
The body is well-formatted, with each line wrapped at ~76 characters. It explains why the change was made and what problem it fixes or addresses.

However, the body does not explicitly state how the code is changed. While it provides a good explanation of the motivation behind the change, it would be beneficial to include more detail on the specific modifications made to the code.

Status: PASS

**Rule Compliance Summary**
The commit message follows some rules:

* The subject line starts with the package name.
* The body is well-formatted and explains why the change was made.
* It includes a `Change-Id` and other relevant information in the footer.

However, it fails to meet some requirements:

* The subject verb should be in lowercase.
* The commit message does not explicitly state how the code is changed.

**Verdict: LINT_FAIL**
